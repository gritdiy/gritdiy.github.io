There is some version of my perfect world in which I am an artist who makes a living doing art. In this dream world I create amazing art (music really) and people just resonate with it, love it, and can’t get enough of it. I spent much of my life dreaming of this. Well, this is awkward… it didn’t happen. Big fat surprise to me, I didn’t become a rock star!

Well it’s not THAT big of a surprise. I’ve gone through several versions of what it means to be an artist everyday since that time, and where my mind loves to go is DIY. DIY kids stuff, DIY house stuff, DIY music, DIY everything. Since my littlest one came into the world, I have been able to quit my day job and stay home with the munchkins. This affords me both the privilege and necessity of DIY. I have a certain amount of flexibility, but also a strict budget. Hello invention! Love love love it, and as an extremely stubborn person, I have my own version of what DIY means.

This vision is what I want to share here. Pinterest perfect is just fine, but I think there is room for a whole lot more than that, like messy stuff. My mantra lately has been DIY more, less perfectly, and I have learned so much in the process. What I’d like to explore is the creative process and how that relates to function, with a good amount of questioning of convention. Where are the DIYers who are first stubborn artists? I know the others are out there. Let’s have discussions about it.
