Years ago, hubby and I bought an obviously DIYed queen platform bed from the neighborhood convenience store for $20. It was lying outside, and they'd occasionally throw fruit on it and call it a fruit stand. It always looked jankey and over-engineered, but we were happy. Years later we realized that although we are relatively averaged sized people, our dreams are king sized. We got a bed to match and have been sleeping like kittens (who wear earplugs) ever since.

Now the queen platform had to go. At the last minute before curbing the thing, I grabbed the new Floating Action album and a sledge hammer and went to town. Here was a pile of free wood (some of which was hopelessly stuck together with giant nails pointing in and coming from every direction.) I needed a bathroom vanity to fit a free sink I had acquired. I had a pile of wood. So I looked at photos of things on line and came up with this design. At the moment it is being used as a standing desk by the hubs and I am considering how to finish it. Stayed tuned to see what happens! Same bat blog, same bat internet.
