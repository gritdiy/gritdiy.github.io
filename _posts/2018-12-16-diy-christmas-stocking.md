title: DIY Christmas Stocking
---

1. Cut stocking shape out of thick felt. (I used another stocking to get the size and rough shape, and traced around it on paper. When I got the shape I liked, I cut that out. Then I lightly outlined around the template onto the felt using a marker.)
2. Sew together the two pieces using a machine. (You could also use a blanket stitch.)
3. Hand sew on fun ribbons and borders!
4. I used hemp to make the letters. Using a big ol needle I sewed through the felt, eyeballing the letters as I went. Then to shape them up a bit, I sewed stitches in strategic places. You may want to use colored hemp to make the names stand out more, your choice!
5. Then cut strips in the felt, double over, and machine sew them on the back inside for hanging!

Notes: Easy peasy, but the “stripes” take a little time. I chose to leave the back blank so as to double my speed!
